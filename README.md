# radiation-treatment-planning
This software project implements a basic quadratic programming formulation of radiation treatment planning, roughly according to Section 2.3 of Hamid Ghaffari's [2012 Ph.D. thesis](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/34010) for the University of Toronto. A MATLAB LiveScript of a simple demonstration is published [here](http://sloan.nietert.me/radiation-treatment-planning/).

The ``+planning`` folder contains the package responsible for the treatment planning itself, and the ``+voxelgrid`` folder contains a package with basic utilities for working with voxel grids. All classes and functions are documented according to MATLAB help conventions.
